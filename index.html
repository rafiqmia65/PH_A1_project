                <p class="yunus_bio">Dr. Muhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Hathazari, Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a renowned Bangladeshi economist, entrepreneur, and civil society leader. He is best known for founding the Grameen Bank in 1983 and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance1. His innovative approach to providing small loans to the impoverished without requiring collateral has empowered millions of people worldwide.
                Yunus earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in economics from the University of Dhaka and a Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States. He began his academic career as a professor at Chittagong University before returning to Bangladesh to address the economic challenges faced by the poor2.
                    
                In 2006, Dr. Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. He has also received numerous other prestigious awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 20101.
                    
                Beyond his work with Grameen Bank, Yunus has been involved in various global initiatives and organizations, such as the United Nations Foundation and Grameen America. He has also served as Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 20181.
                    
                In 2024, following political unrest in Bangladesh, Dr. Yunus was appointed as the Chief Adviser of the Interim Government, tasked with leading the country through a period of transition. His leadership and vision continue to inspire many around the world.
                    
                Would you like to know more about his contributions or any specific aspect of his work?
